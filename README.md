This is an academic project completed as the final assignment of the Avito Analysts Academy course in the Data Science track.

## Task

**Smart Camera**

Imagine you see a cool sports car on the street and wonder — how much does it cost?  
Or you notice a stylish item in a friend's interior but feel shy to ask about it.  
The **Smart Camera** is an app that can help with that.  
It can estimate the approximate price of a product — or even multiple objects — just from a photo.
